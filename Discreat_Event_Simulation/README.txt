Simulator based on RISC-V architecture.

To run you are supposed to provide three arguments <path-to-config-file> <path-to-stat-file> <path-to-object-file> .

Configuratin file is /Discreat_Event_Simulation/configuration/config.xml

stat file is /Discreat_Event_Simulation/stats/stat.txt


Object files are the binary files of risc-v code , some exmaples of binary file are in  /Discreat_Event_Simulation/test_cases
E.X - /Discreat_Event_Simulation/test_cases/prime.out
